Astronomy Picture of the Day Search
Web Application Mockup Overview
For my project, I created three main pages: Home, Favourites, and Explore Space. Each page features a space-themed background image to maintain a consistent look and feel across the site. Here’s an overview of the features I implemented:
• Home Page: I added a search button to make it easier for users to search for the Astronomy Picture of the Day. My logo is placed in the top left corner for consistent branding.
• Favourites Page: Users can save and delete images using intuitive icons. The functionality is powered by local storage, allowing users to manage their favourite images easily.
• Explore Space Page: This page provides users with recommendations for space-related content such as movies, books, and podcasts, along with fascinating information about space.
I chose Roboto as the font to ensure readability and a modern aesthetic. The website is responsive on smaller screen by adjusting typography and image sizes.
